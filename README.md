## Extensible?
You Betcha!

Extensions are not addons or plugins, but real code on top of &lambda;iquid. So any Clojure code can be used and any Java jar file for that matter. No special plugin language, just real code. So take your favorite Java library and add it to the classpath. Setup a few shortcuts in the .liq file and now &lambda;iquid integrates with your favorite tool.

Include [Additives](https://github.com/mogenslund/additives) for even more functionality.

## Installation

### Download and execution

#### Quick start
Download the single jar (Uberjar containing both Clojure and Liquid) [liq.jar](http://salza.dk/liq.jar)  

**IMPORTANT** Please have the [Cheatsheet](https://github.com/mogenslund/liquid/wiki/Cheat-Sheet) nearby when using Liquid for the first time. The keybindings are powerful, but needs to be learned.

On Windows double click the liq.jar.  
On Linux and Mac execute the following in a terminal:

    java -jar liq.jar

If the terminal causes problems, like hard to see colors or artifacts when navigating, try the JFrame implementation:

    java -jar liq.jar --jframe

My experience is that the terminal "Terminology", with dark background works very well.

#### Local setup and extensions
For a recommended approach to local setup and managing extensions, please read

[Basic Setup](http://salza.dk/setupbasic.html)

#### Salza &lambda;iquid text editor is designed with clojure developers in mind

The editor is written in pure Clojure. That is, there are no other dependencies, not even curses or lanterna!

I have been using Emacs for many years. I have tweaked it a lot and implemented modes, to simulate the Vim way of switching between insert mode and normal mode for navigation. I like being able to use the whole keyboard for navigation. As you will see in the video below, I am very inspired by Emacs and Vim, but I have choosen not to try to copy or reimplement Emacs or Vim. I have only stolen the features that I need or like. I hope others will just create plugins or extensions to make the editor support other features that they like.

I could tell a lot about the editor, but I think you should see the video below for a demonstration.



#### Other run configurations
Download [liquid-0.8.6.jar](https://github.com/mogenslund/liquid/releases/download/v0.8.6/liquid-0.8.6.jar)
Also download clojure-1.8.0.jar from [clojure.org](http://clojure.org/community/downloads)

Execute the program with:

    java -cp clojure-1.8.0.jar:liquid-0.8.6.jar clojure.main -m dk.salza.liq.core

To run as webserver use:

    java -cp clojure-1.8.0.jar:liquid-0.8.6.jar clojure.main -m dk.salza.liq.core --server --port=8520

and access using:

    http://localhost:8520

(This approach will also work in Windows. Remember to replace ":" with ";" in the "-cp" on Windows. The best performance seems to be in Chrome browser.)

For running in terminal and as serve at the same time use:

    java -cp clojure-1.8.0.jar:liquid-0.8.6.jar clojure.main -m dk.salza.liq.core --web --port=8520

Use --autoupdate for making multiple browser automatically sync content. (For collaborative editing.)

## Demo video

## Technical video explaining the core datastructure of the editor
This video is for technical minded people to get a view of the inside of the construction of the editor. Useful for understanding the idea behind the editor or as inspiration for similar projects or extensions of this: [slider01](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B5Au3PxHCmgBNjJodzNjQ2w4c2M/view?usp=sharing)

## Use cases
 * <b>Tight integration</b> with Clojure code. It should be easy to have the same code executed from within the editor as well as outside. Using a real language for extensions provides a great advantage compared to a "home made" extension language, that only fits the specific editor.  
Example: As a QA Engineer I do test automation using Selenium WebDriver. I have included the Selenium jar into my local environment, so now I can execute tests, parts of tests or snippets from within &lambda;iquid.  
All other tools that I create in Clojure, which are useful as is, are easy to make accessible from within the editor as well.

 * <b>Embedding</b> the editor into your your application. Include the &lambda;iquid to your project and use it as part of your program or for debugging and patching, just like you already do with the REPL, but with some advantages: It is easier to open a file with code and execute parts of it, or jump between snippets, do modifications, and execute again.  
Example: I have a file with snippets like: `(patch "myserver")`, `(status "myserver")` and `(run-test "name-of-test")`. I just modify "myserver", if needed, and press "e" to execute the command.

## Status of the application
Most of the basic features I want are in place, but needs to be described further and polished.

The extension system also needs to mature, with best practices and well-defined integration points. I may still have to do changes to some basic structures to accommodate this.

#### Known bugs
No known bugs at the moment.

### Leiningen
Clone the github project and execute the command below to generate a jar file

    lein uberjar

or just to run

    lein run

## Dependencies
Right now the only dependency is Clojure itself. I would like to keep it that way, as for core functionality. When starting Liquid, any resources can just be added to the classpath, and the code will be available from inside Liquid. So it is not a limitation to Liquid, it just means that anything requiring other dependencies should be implemented as plugins and be loaded together with Liquid. Extensions can be loaded through a .liq file in the home folder.

## Inspiration from Emacs and Vi
From Emacs I have been inspired by extensibility. Clojure is also the language for writing extensions. That was in fact a primary motivation for creating the editor. Actually it is possible to include the editor into a project and make the editor part of the program. This thought is very similar to the REPL (read-eval-print-loop), but more like an edit-eval-render-loop.

From Vi I have stolen the concept of normal/insert mode. I really like the ability to use the whole keyboard to navigate the file and execute commands at one time, while typing text in another. The tab key is used to switch between the two modes. The color of the cursor will indicate which mode is in use. I have resisted the attempt to use the same keybindings as Vi. Some are the same, but as default I have chosen the keys jkli as navigation keys. They are located where the fingers are placed and layed out like the arrow keys. Look at jkli on the keyboard. Different up and down operations are mapped to different combinations with "i" and "k" (up and down), while different sideway actions are mapped to "j" and "l". E.g going to the end of the line is done with shift+l and the beginning of the line with shift+j.

S-expressions in clojure can be evaluated with "e", while the whole file is evaluated with shift+e.

Extending the functionality is done by including the classpath to the wanted code, when starting &lambda;iquid and using the .liq file to require the code or remap keys to use the new code or whatever code that needs to run to integrate the code into the editor..

## Sample .liq file
Modify the content below and save it to .liq in your home directory:

```clojure
(ns user
  (:require [clojure.string :as str]
            [dk.salza.liq.editor :as editor])
  (:use [dk.salza.liq.tools.cshell]))

(editor/add-searchpath "/tmp")              ; Files below /tmp will now be chooseable from the Ctrl+Space chooser
(editor/add-snippet "Something to insert.") ; This snippet will be available from the Ctrl+Space chooser
(editor/add-file "/tmp/tmp.clj")            ; Open /tmp/tmp.clj for editing
(editor/add-file (str (System/getProperty "user.home") ".liq")) ; Open .liq file for editing
```

## Options
It is not working yet, but at some time the argument "--jframe" should start a JFrame implementation of the view.
